## Quarter 2 Project Questions
1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
I think the most interesting topic that was covered would have to be simply diffusion models in general. Despite such a very small algorithm, as long as the network is complex enough, new images are able to be generated without being exact copies of the dataset. I think this is a very interesting and powerful ability of generative models, as they can be used to help possibly add more diversity and new views to old ideas.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
A potential investigation I would like to pursue would be the use of generative models on either 3d models in fashion-design. Given how novel and unique fashion pieces become, I wonder if a generative model would still be able to design clothes that can fit humans and also adjust to given styles of fashion. It would also be very interesting if we could derive elements from multiple fashion-styles into one new outfit.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
I would most likely change our focus from changing noise-prediction to possibly testing new datasets that haven't been tested. Since a lot of the basis for diffusion models were based on the gaussian distribution's properties, I don't think that there would be anything to produce a marginal gain for generating new models. I would've possibly enjoyed looking at the results, as simply numbers and (subjective) results can only provide so much motivation.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
I would be interested in using possibly using transformers and attention to help guide the diffusion process. In the Stable Diffusion model and Encoder-Decoder architecture, both encode text into a vector in order to help guide the output, which is something that we didn't get much time to explore during our Q1 project. I think that word-to-text techniques would be very interesting to explore, and it could possibly help us guide the generative process of the diffusion model instead of simply allowing it to create an output off of purely noise.
